notes:
  - >
    This manifest defines an atomic operational assurance
    baseline specific to the onboarding capability.
  - >
    Feature-level operational assurances complement, but do not
    weaken, system-level operational guarantees.
  - >
    All traceability to upstream artefacts is version-aware
    to ensure reproducible operational assurance over time.
