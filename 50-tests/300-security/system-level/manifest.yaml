notes:
  - >
    This manifest defines an atomic system-level security assurance baseline.
    All contained artefacts inherit the version and lifecycle state
    declared here and MUST NOT declare their own.
  - >
    System-level security scenarios apply across all features and
    MUST be satisfied regardless of feature-specific behaviour.
  - >
    Traceability to upstream artefacts is version-aware by design
    to ensure auditability over time.
